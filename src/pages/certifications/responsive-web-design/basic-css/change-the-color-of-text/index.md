## Change the Color of Text

You can change the color of text in CSS using the `color` property.

### EXAMPLE

```
color: red;
```

## SOLUTION

```
<h2 style="color: red;">CatPhotoApp</h2> as you see in the example it would have to go inside the <h2> bracket. <h2 GOES HERE>, as follows <h2 style="color: red;"> the text that follows, in the example being CatPhotoApp will turn red.
```
